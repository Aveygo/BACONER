Simple tampermonkey script that removes channel placed sponsored messages.

Works by removing pinned youtube comments or descriptions that contain at least three of the following "trigger" words:

```sign up, start, sale, ends, free, trial, first, promo, code, % off, http, sponsored by, visit, check out, purchase, go to, head over, merch, support, deal, discount, today```
